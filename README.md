# Google Authentication With Astro

This repo is for the blog post [Setup Google Authentication in Astro](https://everythingcs.dev/blog/astro-js-google-auth/) at everythingcs.dev

This project uses googleapis package to implement google account login in astro app.

JWt based strategy is used for persistence which is stored in cookies as session.

I have also demonstrated protected page and protected api route.
